# ai-switch

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ai-switch.svg?color=cb3837)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-switch)

`ai-switch` is a lightweight Node/TypeScript CLI that locates (via `which`), optionally installs, and launches one of three coding agents (Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI). It can layer project defaults, surface each tool's documented YOLO flag, and always shows the exact command before it runs. It is published as a verified package on npm.

## Features
- `ai use [tool]` launches Codex, Claude, or Gemini; omit the tool to pick interactively or fall back to the project's configured default.
- If the binary is missing, the CLI offers curated install commands (npm / Homebrew) and streams output so you can see what runs.
- `--dry-run` prints the resolved launch/install command without executing anything, helping you sanity-check automation.
- `ai yolo <tool>` forwards the first documented skip-approvals flag for that tool and prints a bold warning.
- `ai doctor` reports PATH status for every supported agent in a quick checklist.
- Arguments after `--` are passed verbatim to the downstream CLI; defaults from `.ai-switch.json` are prepended first.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build           # emits compiled JS to dist/src
npm link                # exposes the `ai` binary from dist/src/index.js
```

## Usage

```bash
ai                      # interactive picker unless a default tool is configured
ai use codex            # launch OpenAI Codex in the current directory
ai use claude -- --help # pass flags through with "--"
ai --dry-run use gemini -- --version
ai yolo codex           # launch with the tool's YOLO/skip-approvals flag
ai doctor               # show which binaries are currently on PATH
```

When YOLO mode is requested, the wrapper warns in red and only appends the first YOLO flag declared for the tool (e.g. Codex `--yolo`). If a tool has no documented skip-approvals flag, it simply launches normally after warning you.

## Project configuration

Add an optional `.ai-switch.json` to your project root to establish defaults for `use` and `yolo` commands:

```json
{
  "defaultTool": "codex",
  "defaultFlags": ["--model", "gpt-5-codex"]
}
```

- `defaultTool` is used whenever you run `ai`/`ai use` without specifying a tool.
- `defaultFlags` are inserted ahead of any passthrough args (including those provided after `--`).

The loader validates both fields: unknown tools or non-string arrays are ignored with a console warning so the CLI never crashes on malformed config, and parse errors fall back to empty defaults.

## Safety defaults

Every downstream CLI has its own sandboxing and approval controls. Prefer enabling approvals and a workspace-write sandbox in their native configs so that launching through `ai-switch` inherits those safer defaults. For example, Codex users can add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[session]
approval_policy = "auto"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

## Doctor command

`ai doctor` runs a simple PATH probe for each supported tool. Missing binaries show up with a yellow cross and will trigger the installer prompt the next time you run `ai use` / `ai yolo`.

## Security

- `npm audit` (last run 2025-09-20) reports zero known vulnerabilities after upgrading dev tooling to `vitest@^3.2.4`.
- Installer commands are hard-coded and executed with `execaCommand`; tool launches use argv arrays to avoid shell injection (Windows uses `shell: true` only to support `.cmd` shims).
- Treat `.ai-switch.json` as trusted input; untrusted defaults could add flags to downstream CLIs, so review contributions before committing.
- Run `npm audit` and `npm test` before publishing new versions to catch regressions early.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The sources live in `src/` and compile to `dist/src`. Keep the build output current before publishing or linking locally.

## Roadmap

- Expand the catalog of supported coding agents (Copilot CLI, Cursor, Zed Agent, etc.)
- Add a VS Code command runner that shells out to `ai use <tool>`
- Offer optional Docker sandbox profiles for YOLO sessions
- Replace the prompt with a richer Ink-powered TUI picker
